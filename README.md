# 🚀 Web Dev Learning Tracker - MERN Stack

This repository is my personal space to track my **daily learning progress** in the **MERN Stack** — MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js.

It contains only the code I practice each day while learning full-stack web development. No full projects, challenges, or notes — just the raw code that helps me understand the core concepts better.
